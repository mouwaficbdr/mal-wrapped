# MAL Wrapped 🎌

Your year in anime, wrapped up nice and pretty. Think Spotify Wrapped, but for your MyAnimeList account.

## What is this?

Connect your MyAnimeList account and get a beautiful, animated slideshow of your anime and manga stats. See your top shows, hidden gems, favorite genres, watch time, and more—all wrapped up in a gorgeous interface.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install stuff
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Get your MyAnimeList API key
- Head over to [MyAnimeList API settings](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig)
- Create a new app
- Copy your Client ID

### 3. Add your Client ID
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAL_CLIENT_ID` in your environment variables (or `.env.local`)
- Set `MAL_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment variables (for production)

### 4. Set up your redirect URI
In your MAL app settings, add your redirect URI:
- **Local:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Production:** Your actual domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)

The redirect URI must match exactly—check what's shown on the login page if you're not sure.

### 5. Run it
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, click "Connect with MAL", and enjoy your wrapped!
